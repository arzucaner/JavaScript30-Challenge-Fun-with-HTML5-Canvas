# JavaScript30 Challenge Fun with HTML5 Canvas

---

## The "JavaScript30 Challenge Fun with HTML5 Canvas" project is part of Wes Bos's "JavaScript30" challenge series. In this particular project, participants learn how to create a fun and interactive drawing app using the HTML5 canvas element and JavaScript.

The project consists of a series of coding challenges that gradually introduce concepts related to drawing on the canvas element, manipulating colors, and detecting mouse events in JavaScript. Participants will learn how to use the canvas element to draw shapes, lines, and text, and how to change the stroke and fill styles.

Throughout the project, participants will work with various JavaScript events and methods, including mousemove(), mouseup(), and mousedown(). They will also learn how to detect the current mouse position on the canvas and use it to draw lines and shapes.
